# SwipeFromLeftWithSnapback

__NOTE: I've since made a Pod out of this example project, it's [available here](https://github.com/iandundas/SwipeAndSnapCell).__

*This version is no longer maintained.*

An example implementation of the swipeable cell used in iOS10's Mail.app, where you can swipe fully across to perform the action immediately.

It now also supports swiping from the right as well.

(Swift 3.0)

I hope it's useful to somebody, I'll be using it in v2.0 of [Tacks](http://www.tacks.cc).
